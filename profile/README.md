## Hi there üëã

I already wrote the description of the project as if it's already an established organization, but it is not. I'm searching for developers, lawyers and advertisers interested in the project!

What is Truce?üè†

Truce is a decentralized ecommerce that promotes local stores, all the money you pay for a good goes directly to the seller. Truce is made to be, as far as possible, similar to the online shops you already use; so, when you are searching for something, you‚Äôll not even notice that you are using a decentralized system.

How will you earn moneyüí∞?

The application is decentralized so we just need money for the developers, the lawyers and the advertisers, we don‚Äôt have to build and maintain a huge and expansive network infrastructure. So we‚Äôll just earn money from advertisement, but it will not be specific for you, because we want your data to be yours, and we will accept to advertise only local products.

How do you build a p2p decentralized ecommerceü§ù?

Every city (or village) will have a truce instance, the truce instance is needed to group all the stores of your city so you can view them in a storefront like the one that you already use. All the truce instances will talk to each other, so when you search for a product and it‚Äôs not near to you (it means it‚Äôs not in the instance of your city), you will find it anyway.

Stores will also contribute to the platform: every store will host its part of the system: when you buy a product, the computational cost of the operation is processed by the store. The store will have different ways to connect to the local instance, if a store doesn‚Äôt handle lots of requests then it just need a browser to be part of the network. If the store needs to handle thousands of requests per seconds then a more powerful architecture is needed but we will help configuring it.

What about the delivery?

Truce comes with a delivery service that works like Bolt or uber eat: a network of cyclist that cover the local area. An algorithm calculates the best and cheapest route to deliver your goods.

Also the delivery service will be commission-free, when a good is delivered, the money for the delivery goes directly to the cyclists involved.

When you buy something from far away a cyclist can‚Äôt do the job, so the app will suggest the cheapest delivery method from a third party delivery service.

what about currencyüí∏üí≥?

Because Truce is p2p enabled and built on the blockchain, Truce comes with a p2p exchange for users to easily buy directly to their decentralized wallet and sellers to easily withdraw from their wallets to their local bank

Relevant Technology

I'm open to discuss about which language or protocol fit best this idea

Who is this for?

The project is very ambitious so everyone is welcome, of course experienced developers are needed to contribute

Complexity and required time

Truce is an ambitious project, from a programming point of view, building a decentralized system is something difficult, there are a lot of concept involved. But a first version of Truce, without the complete decentralization implemented could be ready in just 3 months. Later, for the next 9 months, we could decentralized every piece of Truce while it is already online.

So in total we need some time to launch Truce.

Complexity Beginner - This project requires no or little prior knowledge of the technolog(y|ies) specified to contribute to the project Intermediate - The user should have some prior knowledge of the technolog(y|ies) to the point where they know how to use it, but not necessarily all the nooks and crannies of the technology Advanced - The project requires the user to have a good understanding of all components of the project to contribute

Required time (ETA) Little work - A couple of days Medium work - A week or two Much work - The project will take more than a couple of weeks and serious planning is required
